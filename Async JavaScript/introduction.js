// what and why JS 
// js is synchronous, blocking and single threaded language 

// synchoronous = execution starts from top to down and executes one thing at a time 
// blocking = no matter how long a task takes, it will not pass to execution of other task before finishing it
// single threaded = a thread is a process our js program uses to run a code (instruction)
    // it excecutes single thread at a time.
